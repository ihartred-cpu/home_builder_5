    never runs the cleanup an HB5 asset needs (wall miter recompute,
    neighbor constraint removal, etc.). This operator classifies the active

    Each HB5 delete operator already sweeps ``selected_objects`` for its own

    without extra handling here - the active object only decides which kind
    is targeted. Mixed selections delete the active object's kind only.

    The cabinet, appliance, and door/window checks all run before the wall
    check on purpose: those assets sit in the wall's parent chain (a door
    or window BP is a direct child of the wall BP), so the wall test would
    otherwise misfire and delete the whole wall instead of the asset on it.
