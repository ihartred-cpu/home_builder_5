"""Face frame cabinet construction classes.

Phase 3a deliverable: class hierarchy and a minimal carcass build.
- FaceFrameCabinet: base class for all face frame cabinets. No drivers.
  All dimension propagation runs through cabinet.recalculate().
- BaseFaceFrameCabinet, UpperFaceFrameCabinet, TallFaceFrameCabinet,
  LapDrawerFaceFrameCabinet: subclasses with type-specific defaults.
- FaceFrameBay: bay cage object (Phase 3b will populate bay contents).

Carcass conventions match frameless (same CabinetPart GeoNode setup):
- Cabinet origin at back-left, floor level
- +X is right, -Y is forward (depth runs in -Y), +Z is up
- Back panel sits at y=0; front of cabinet is at y=-depth
- Mirror Y=True on a part means it extrudes in -Y from its origin
- Mirror Z=True means it extrudes in -Z from its origin

        """Spawn / resize / remove finish liner panels for finished bays
        and finished openings.

        A finished region (a whole bay via finish_bay, or a single opening
        via finish_opening) gets 1/4 finish-material liner panels on its
        inner faces so the exterior finish reads inside it. FULL finish
        lines the full cavity depth on the LEFT / RIGHT / TOP faces only -
        the back and the bay floor get no applied part; the carcass BACK /
        BOTTOM panels behind the region are cut from finish stock instead
        (solver's finish_carcass flag splits those segments so unfinished
        neighbouring bays keep interior panels). A finished OPENING adds
        no ceiling part either - the panel over it is a real part
        already - so a FULL opening finish is its two sides (plus a back
        when the bay around it is unfinished). FLUSH finish lines the FF
        opening with a band flush to the FF front face, running
        finish_*_flush_depth back (0 = full depth) on all four sides with
        no BACK panel (open behind for an appliance). A removed bay bottom
        runs the verticals to the floor. The geometry is identical for
        bays and openings - only the region bounds differ - so both route
        through _finish_region_specs.

        A bay-level finish supersedes per-opening finishes within that bay
        (the bay liner already covers everything). Liners are keyed by
        (bay_index, opening_index, face) - opening_index -1 for a bay-level
        liner - so they reuse in place and sweep cleanly. Angled cabinets
        are deferred (bay-local Y here assumes square).

    - One mirror door per bay, hinged R / R / L. Every door edge takes a
      5/8" overlay (CLIPtop Blumotion 5/8"-overlay hinges), so two
      adjacent doors overlay 5/8 + 5/8 = 1-1/4" of each 1-5/16" mid
      stile and read a 1/16" reveal between the mirrors.
    - Door trim: 1-1/4" wood frame with the MEETING edges left open (no
      trim member) so the mirrors run visually edge-to-edge; only the
      two outer doors keep their outer stile. Stamped as LOCKED
      Set-Door-Frame overrides on each opening cage (the durable store),
      so cabinet edits and style re-applies keep the per-side widths.

    driven by the HB_TRIVIEW_DOORS flag (see solver.front_leaves); that
    solver path remains for files placed before this construction, but
