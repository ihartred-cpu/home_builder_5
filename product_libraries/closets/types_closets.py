"""Closet starter construction classes.

Base / Tall / Hanging / Island starters that build panels, top and
bottom fixed shelves, cleats, toe kicks, openings, and (Base/Island)
countertops. No drivers - all dimension propagation runs
through recalculate(), which reads the hb_closet_starter / hb_closet_bay
PropertyGroups, asks solver_closets for the layout, and writes positions
and GeoNode inputs to every part.

Structure:
    starter root cage (TAG_STARTER_CAGE)
    +-- panel parts 0..N          (shared verticals; panel i left of bay i)
    +-- countertop / applied-back parts (starter-level, per class flags)
    +-- bay cages (TAG_BAY_CAGE, hb_bay_index)
        +-- bottom shelf, top shelf, toe kick, cleat  (bay-local coords)
        +-- opening cage (TAG_OPENING_CAGE)           (interior volume)

Conventions match face_frame: origin back-left at floor, +X right,
-Y forward, +Z up. Vertical panels rotate y=-90 so Length runs up +Z,
Width runs -Y (Mirror Y), Thickness extrudes +X (Mirror Z).
